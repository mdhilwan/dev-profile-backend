    "mainDescription": "Used to be the fittest developer around.<br><br>Having scaled the 6th highest mountain in the world, Cho Oyu in Tibet. Suffered a stroke at the advance base camp (20,000ft). And then proceed to summit the mountain at 8,201m (26,900ft).<br><br>Passionate about the mountains, even more passionate about JS, TS, Java, Angular, React, Vue and anything that lives online. Love to experiment with FirebaseIO and NodeJS and explore ShodanIO once in a while.<br><br>With 13 years of experience, I have been very heavily involved in many projects ranging from rebuilding of full enterprise wide corporate sites supporting multiple locales to experimental data visualizations campaign sites to development of SDKs for payment gateway services to be consumed by merchants.<br><br>Love to share my knowledge and experience, and break complex things down into a simpler explanation. I used to conduct classes twice a week about JavaScript, advance MVC framework and even basic CSS/HTML. There's a lack of \"education\" on basic fundamentals of web technologies among many.",
